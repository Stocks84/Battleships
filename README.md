## The Game

Battleships allows the player up to six guesses per game on a grid size of 5 x 5. The player is hunting down one ship which is no bigger than 1 square. If the player guesses incorrectly a ‘X’ will be marked on the grid and the player has six attempts to hit the ship until the game is over and the player has lost. However, if the player gets a direct hit a ‘@’ will be marked and the player has won.
